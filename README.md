c65 provides a simple 65c02 simulator based on `fake65c02.h` from https://github.com/C-Chads/MyLittle6502 which mimics py65mon
with the same default magic getc and putc memory locations.
It also provides a magic blockio memory address
which supports IO to an external binary file,
and collects simple memory access profiling data.

## Usage

The simplest usage is:

    c65 -r taliforth-py65mon.bin

This loads the TaliForth2 memory image at the top of memory
and resets to the address stored at $fffc. This corresponds exactly to
`py65mon -m 65c02 -r taliforth-py65mon.bin` without the monitor tools.
Various options control the simulator (use `c65 -?` for up-to-date details):

    -a <address>    # load the rom file at a specific address
    -g <address>    # change the reset vector at $fffc
    -t <ticks>      # stop after ticks cycles (default forever)
    -i <address>    # change the magic getc address (default 0xf004)
    -o <address>    # change the magic putc putc address (default 0xf001)
    -x <address>    # change the block io base address (default 0xf010)
    -b <file>       # provide a block file to enable blockio

## Block IO

The base address (default $f010) is the first byte of a six byte interface:

    offset  name    I/O description
    0       action  I   initiate IO action (set other params first)
    1       status  O   returns 0 on success and 0xff otherwise
    2-3     blknum  I   0-indexed low-endian block to read or write
    4-5     bufptr  I   low-endian pointer to 1024 byte buffer to r/w

To initiate a block IO operation, set the `blknum` and `bufptr` parameters
and then write the `action` code to the base address. The `status`
value is returned. Four actions are currently supported:

- status (0): check blkio status returning 0x0 if enabled, 0xff otherwise
- read (1): read the 1024 byte block @ blknum to bufptr
- write (2): write the 1024 byte block @ blknum from bufptr
- exit ($ff): exit from the simulator, dumping profiling data

Note that an external blockfile must be specified with the `-b ...` option
to enable block IO. The file is simply a binary file with block k
mapped to offset k*1024 through (k+1)*1024-1.
The two-byte `blknum` supports a maximum addressable file size of 64Mb.
A portable (cross-platform) check for blkio is writing 1 to `status`,
then writing 0 to `action` and finally checking if `status` is 0.

You can boot from a blkio file by adding the following snippet to
the end of `forth_code/user_words.fs`:

    \ if blkio is available and block 0 starts with the bytes 'TF'
    \ `evaluate` the remainder of block 0 as a zero-terminated string
    \ Tequires the word asciiz> ( addr -- addr n )

    : blkrw ( blk buf action -- )
        -rot $c014 ! $c012 ! $c010 c!
    ;
    :noname
        1 $c011 c! 0 $c010 c! $c011 c@ 0= if  \ blkio available?
            0 $1000 1 blkrw
            $1000 @ $4654 = if                \ starts with magic "TF" ?
                $1002 asciiz> evaluate else   \ run the block
                ." bad boot block" CR
            then else
            ." no block device" CR
        then
    ; execute

## Profiling

After exiting via the blockio hook, the simulator dumps
two files called `c65-coverage.dat` and `c65-writes.dat`.
Each contains a binary dump of 64K `int`s, which respectively
count the number of accesses (read or write) to each memory
location, along with the number of writes.
(The number of reads can be inferred by differencing the arrays.)

These files are useful for profiling "hot spots" in simulated code,
and for ensuring that read-only regions are never written.
The `profile.ipynb` file contains a [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
with some examples of exploring this data.

## Notes

Note I also tried a version based on https://github.com/omarandlorraine/fake6502 but it seems to have some subtle bug. It runs most of TaliForth in 65c02 mode but `: foo 3 2 + ;` fails with a stack underflow.
